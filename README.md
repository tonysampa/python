## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. **Install Python**
   - [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and follow the installation instructions.
   - Verify the installation by running:
     ```bash
     python --version
     ```

### 2. **Set Up Your Environment**
   - **IDE**: Recommended IDEs for Python development:
     - [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
     - [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
     - [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)

   - **Virtual Environment**: Use `venv` to create isolated environments:
     ```bash
     python -m venv myenv
     source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows: myenv\Scripts\activate
     ```

## üêç Python Basics

### 1. **Syntax & Variables**
   - Learn about Python's clean syntax, variables, and data types:
     ```python
     name = "Python"
     version = 3.10
     print(f"Welcome to {name} version {version}")
     ```

### 2. **Control Structures**
   - Master conditionals and loops:
     ```python
     for i in range(5):
         if i % 2 == 0:
             print(f"{i} is even")
         else:
             print(f"{i} is odd")
     ```

### 3. **Functions**
   - Learn how to write reusable code with functions:
     ```python
     def greet(name):
         return f"Hello, {name}!"
     
     print(greet("World"))
     ```

---

## üî• Advanced Topics

### 1. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
   - Classes, objects, and inheritance:
     ```python
     class Animal:
         def __init__(self, name):
             self.name = name
         
         def speak(self):
             return f"{self.name} makes a sound."

     class Dog(Animal):
         def speak(self):
             return f"{self.name} barks."
     
     dog = Dog("Rex")
     print(dog.speak())
     ```

### 2. **Exception Handling**
   - Proper error handling with `try`, `except`:
     ```python
     try:
         result = 10 / 0
     except ZeroDivisionError:
         print("You can't divide by zero!")
     ```

### 3. **Modules & Packages**
   - Organize your code with modules and packages:
     ```python
     # my_module.py
     def add(a, b):
         return a + b
     
     # main.py
     from my_module import add
     print(add(5, 3))
     ```

### 4. **File I/O**
   - Reading from and writing to files:
     ```python
     with open('example.txt', 'w') as file:
         file.write('Hello, Python!')
     ```
